# Introduction
This is a concept of a method of exploring collections. It is aimed at the more curious than knowledgeable, looking for things that they want but maybe don't expect. 20–30:s Internet savvy.

# Problem
Our crowd find themselves paralyzed by an empty search field, blinded by endless pages of seemingly identical results or frustrated about the expressionless query language and abrupt movements between scenery.

* I don't know what I'm looking for!
* I don't know how to articulate my search!
* It is not possible to create a query that reflects my flow of thoughts!

# Solution
Empathetic discovery and search, where you are at the front and center. 

Even if you just know you *really* like pink you should be ready to start exploring!

ATT puts you in the cockpit of the machine that lets you move freely through the dimensions of art and history, ranging from time and space to cuteness and flair. You will be pulled into the flow of serendipitous discovery while being served with the gems that you will claim to make your own.

## Where are you? Position yourself in art and history: time, space, your state of mind/intent, label etc.
This is a world where any artefacts of art or history will eventually meet at a single location and there are infinite paths between them. 

* You can drop your pin in a different location (by starting out from a collection)
* You will explore your surroundings from the most relevant pieces
* You set the rules for rankings as you go (in a friendly dialogue)

## What’s your state of mind? 
You could be starting from an exhibition or your own collection or Google search? Pulling facts to pinpoint a position 

* Adapting to direct your attention to what you would find most interesting 
* Data: Helpful questions
	
## In what direction do you want to go? Moving by clicking a curious example

* Reduce the number of choices by grouping objects and representing them by the most intresting/useful in each group
* Procees in the direction that looks most interesting and discover more items in that direction
* This means that you can walk across space and time but also that you are free to direct your path along any dimension be it Wikipedia categories or labels from Google Vision.
* Data: Your position
* Data: Your selection
* Data: Your path
* Data: Your state of mind
* Data: Paths between objects in the collection
* Result: Best summary of all the objects in your proximity

## The machine
* Illustrate direction / relationship (take a step in a direction of your choice)
* Show the variation / summarize the surrounding objects (look around)
* Describe paths to discovery that are impossible to/difficult to express (sense of direction like footprints on a path)
* Highlight objects that are of special interest to you (catching your eye)

Implementing the interface

* Visually pleasing
* Familiarity
* Tangible

## The bigger vision

Walking along a curated path

How do you create a sense of where you are?

* How do you navigate / manage the flow. Sense of direction. Where you came from and where you are going.

How to summarize the available options from your current viewpoint?

* Showing the results as images, tag clouds, sounds – different methods to summarize
* Embedded question on what media type to explore etc.

How to highlight?

* Ranking. 

How to choose the direction? 

* How do you get feedback from the user? 
* Embed questions in the grid / use a second image to pinpoint  the direction / questionnaire or interests / learning from navigational patterns / learning from other users

How do you get users to contribute with preference?

* Spotify uses it to improve radio, sharing playlists, tracks etc.

Challenges

* How well the object represent the user’s idea of the physical entity
