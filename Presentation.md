This is a concept of a method of exploring collections. It is aimed at the more curious than knowledgeable, looking for things that they want but maybe don't expect. 20–30:s Internet savvy.

# Probelm
Our crowd find themselves paralyzed by an empty search field, blinded by endless pages of seemingly identical results or frustrated about the expressionless query language and abrupt movements between scenery.

* I don't know what I'm looking for!
* I don't know how to articulate my search!
* It is not possible to create a query that reflects my flow of thoughts!

# Solution
Empathetic discovery and search, where you are at the front and center. 

Even if you just know you *really* like pink you should be ready to start exploring!

ATT puts you in the cockpit of the machine that lets you move freely through the dimensions of art and history, ranging from time and space to cuteness and flair. You will be pulled into the flow of serendipitous discovery while being served with the gems that you will claim to make your own.

## Where are you? Position yourself in art and history: time/space, your state of mind/intent
This is a world where any artefacts of art or history will eventually meet at a single location and there are infinite paths between them. 

* You can drop your pin in a different location (by starting out from a collection)
* You will explore your surroundings from the most relevant pieces
* You set the rules for rankings as you go (in a friendly dialogue)

## What’s your state of mind? 
You could be starting from an exhibition or your own collection or Google search? Pulling facts to pinpoint a position 

* Adapting to direct your attention to what you would find most interesting 
* Helpful questions
	
## In what direction do you want to go? Moving by clicking a curious example

* Summary, go in the direction that looks interesting
* This means that you can walk across space and time but also that you are free to direct your path along any dimension be it Wikipedia categories or labels from Google Vision.
* The direction
* Your path
* Your task
