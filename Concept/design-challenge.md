#Problem -- "The Empty Search Bar"
-

Description:
The current solution requires the user to have a concrete search term

assumes the user knows what to search so a search bar is the most natural way to interact with the dataset. But this is made for searching and alienates the users who just want to explore the dataset without a defined search term. 

not searching but explore
dont know how to articulate
it is not possible to articulate my search through the current system
The search result does not reflect real interest
it is not fun to browse through tons of very similar images
hard to get an overview
